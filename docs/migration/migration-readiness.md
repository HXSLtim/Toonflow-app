## Gate Summary

| Gate | Status | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Worktree setup | ✅ PASS | dual-worktree model established (`master` + `migration/full-stack-separation`) |
| Dependency/bootstrap | ✅ PASS (with caveat) | API install required `--legacy-peer-deps`; documented |
| Feature baseline | ✅ PASS | 119 baseline items generated |
| Parity matrix | ✅ PASS | no `❌ Missing`; content-level partial deltas documented |
| Automated validation (lint/test/build) | ✅ PASS | all three commands exit code 0 |
| Functional smoke | ❌ FAIL | health endpoint 503; web root/login 404 under current runtime |

## Critical Findings Blocking Readiness
1. `GET /monitoring/health` returns `503` with payload indicating database probe issue: `db.raw is not a function`.
2. Web service smoke checks (`/`, `/login` on `localhost:5173`) returned `404` in current run mode.

## Week1 Baseline Blockers Snapshot
- Formal baseline snapshot: `docs/migration/week1-baseline-blockers-snapshot.md`
- Purpose: lock immediate blockers before fixes, and track closure against a stable pre-fix reference.

## Week1 Recovery Plan
- Recovery baseline: `docs/migration/week1-blockers-baseline.md`
- Execution rule: close each blocker by meeting its `acceptance-target` with refreshed smoke evidence.
- Closure checkpoints:
  1. Verify health probe blocker (`W1-BLK-001`) is resolved and evidence is updated.
  2. Verify web route blocker (`W1-BLK-002`) is resolved using `docs/migration/week1-web-smoke-runbook.md`, and evidence is updated.
  3. Re-run full readiness evaluation before lifting `NOT READY`.

## Readiness Decision
**Migration readiness: NOT READY**

Rationale: despite automated gates passing and parity coverage complete, functional smoke gate failed on service health and web route reachability. According to the migration criteria (“测试优先 + 功能不缺失”), readiness cannot be marked as pass.

## Recommended Next Actions
1. Fix monitoring health DB probe implementation for current DB client behavior.
2. Verify and correct web dev server route handling / invocation mode in migration workspace.
3. Re-run smoke validation and update this report with PASS evidence.
